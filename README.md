## Course «OOP»

The main task is using of MVC pattern in the graphical application (similar functionality to Linux text editor – VIM). It must work with a text files for editing of text.
Basic requirements:
1)	Use MVC, observer, adapter and etc. patterns.
2)	When writing a program, observe the basic conditions: the program must be written in C ++ using STL; the program must be developed using the MVC; the program must have TUI - Text User Interface. TUI must support the cursor and status bar. The status bar should display the current operating mode, the name of the file, line number / total lines; the program must work with 1-byte text encoding; the program must support 4 modes: normal mode, insert mode, command mode, and search mode; to work with text, you need to use your own string class in the form of a static or dynamic library.

!!To work with strings, you must use the MyString class implemented in the first lab.
